Hey, it'sa me, King Dub Dub!

If you're reading this, you must have downloaded my code off of Github or are thinking about it!
Thank you for noticing me, I hope my Quadratic Companian helps you out, it sure has helped me on all my projects.

Installation instructions:
1. Download the Quadratic Companion script.
2. Install the TI-Connect CE software for your computer. (https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw)
3. Plug your calculator into your PC.
4. Open the TI-Connect software and make sure you can see your calculator.
5. Click-n'-Drag the Quadratic Companion.8xp file onto your calculator.
6. Send the file to your calculator, MAKE SURE IT GOES TO ARCHIVE, NOT RAM. If you send it to the RAM and your calculator dies/crashes,  it will disappear.
7. Open the program on your calculator with the "prgm" button, it should say QUADCOMP.
8. Run it, enter your variables, and be the first person to finish the algebra quiz!

How To Use:
Enter the A,B, and C variables into the input lines, and the calculator will do the rest! But remember:
-If a variable isn't in the equation you are trying to solve, then you enter it as zero.
-You can't enter zero as A, that is not a solvable equation.
-If your calculator says "No X-intercepts", it means that your formula will not cross the X-axis when graphed.
	-It still gives an answer though, but that is with the magical-quantum number "i". Ask your math teacher to explain, it's a good          lesson.
-When done, press 1 to quit, 2 to leave, or 3 for some info. Don't press anything else. . .

Frequently Asked Questions:

Q: My calculator has an error that says "NONREAL ANSWERS", how do I fix this?
A: You need to hit that "mode" button, find the REAL setting, and change it to a+bi to set your calculator to the right mode. If you haven't learned about nonreal numbers yet, you probably just entered your numbers wrong.

Q: Your program disappeared from my calculator!
A: You put it in the RAM memory, which is a way for the calculator to store its memory while it has power. If it dies or has a big problem, the RAM is cleaned and all programs/variables saved there will disappear. Save all of your important programs to Archive if you want them to stay around.

Q: I can't edit the code on my calculator!
A: Here's a secret: I SET IT THAT WAY. I wanted to make sure someone didn't accidently damage the code unless they knew what they were doing (I have done that so many times now). If you want to change it, just open it in the TI-Connect software, click the lock icon, and send the script to your calculator. Be careful changing anything, you might break the script and you don't want to break it during study-hall before the math test!

Q: I want to program my own code!
A: That's awsome! If you use my code though, just remember to mark that I made the original script, because plagarism is wrong, and you don't want to mess with an angry computer nerd. If you want to write your own special scripts, go and google "ti basic tutorial", there are plenty of resources online that can teach you how to code BASIC during chemistry class (don't do it during chemistry though, it's kinda dangerous to get distracted in there).

Q: I am bored and was searching Github and found this code.
A: That's more of a statement, but yeah, I've done that too. Don't just randomly browse the internet though, its a magical place, but there are a lot of messed-up perverts and jerks putting their stuff up too. Be careful what you search, hurry before it's too late!

Thank you for downloading my Quadratic Companion script. I hope you enjoy, and maybe join me in the calculator hacking field too!
